# bell-and-hapi-auth-cookie

This an example to use both Hapi's Bell plugin where you could login using the Twitter API (or others such as github, facebook etc). But using bell alone will only keep you signed on a single page, this is where the Hapi-auth-cookie comes into place.

```
npm install hapi
npm install bell
npm install hapi-auth-cookie
npm install getconfig
```
